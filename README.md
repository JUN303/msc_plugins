<h3>Acknowledgment:</h3>
I started this plugin as an improvement of the "Find Harmonies" plugin by Andresn 
	(https://github.com/andresn/standard-notation-experiments/tree/master/MuseScore/plugins/findharmonies)
	itself being an enhanced version of "findharmony" by Merte (http://musescore.org/en/project/findharmony)
I took some lines of code or got inspiration from:
- Berteh (https://github.com/berteh/musescore-chordsToNotes/)
- Jon Ensminger (AddNoteNameNoteHeads v. 1.2 plugin)

--> Thank you :-)
